<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/">268. Missing Number</a></h2><h3>Easy</h3><hr><div><p>Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.</p>


<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [3,0,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [0,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 8
<strong>Explanation:</strong> n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
</pre>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>n == nums.length</li>
	<li>1 <= n <= 104</li>
	<li>0 <= nums[i] <= n</li>
	<li>All the numbers of nums are unique.</li>
</ul>
